          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny&#8217;s worth.

            I&#8217;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
            intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
            time of my life. Since completing the course, I&#8217;ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup.</q

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
          Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
          easy.

            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart

            Before joining the bootcamp, I&#8217;ve never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I&#8217;ve often referred to it during interviews as
            an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
            a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend!</q
